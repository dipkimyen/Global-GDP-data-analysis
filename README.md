## Overview

The notebook `GDP_BY_COUNTRY.ipynb` contains a comprehensive analysis of global GDP data. Key features of the analysis include:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualization of GDP trends by country
- Comparison of GDP figures across different countries

## Installation

To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dipkimyen/Global-GDP-data-analysis.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   cd Global-GDP-data-analysis'''
3. Install the required Python packages. It is recommended to use a virtual environment. Create and activate a virtual environment, then install the dependencies:
   '''bash
   python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
  pip install -r requirements.txt'''

## Usage

To run the analysis:
1. Open Jupyter Notebook:
'''bash
jupyter notebook'''
2. In the Jupyter interface, navigate to GDP_BY_COUNTRY.ipynb and open it.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to perform the analysis. The notebook contains code cells for data loading, preprocessing, visualization, and interpretation of results.

Results
The notebook generates various visualizations and insights, including:
- GDP Trends by Country: Visualizations showing GDP growth over time for different countries.
- Comparison of GDP Figures: Comparative analysis of GDP figures across countries.
